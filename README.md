# WebP
https://developers.google.com/speed/webp

- WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for **images** on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.
- WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG iamges at equivalent SSIM index

## SSIM index 
### 1. Perception-base model
Perception Based Modeling focuses on closing the gap between individual decisions based on context-related perception and the integration of this individual knowledge and preconceived expectations into mobility simulations. In order to develop simulation tools which can represent the complexity of an individualâ€™s interaction with the environment, a comprehensive understanding of human perception is of vital importance. In this research study we will examine how the human perception of urban environments can be captured and integrated into mobility simulations as a computational model.

Perception Based Modeling is part of the research collaboration between the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

### 2. SSIM (Structural similarity)
https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Structural_similarity
The structure similarity index measure (SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is sued for measuring the similarity between two 2 images. The SSIM index is a full reference metric; in other words, the measurement or prediction of images quality is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference. 

- SSIM is a perception-base model
